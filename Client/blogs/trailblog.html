            To simplify sharing and testing of your React app, containerize it with Docker:<br>
            
            Create React App:
            Use npx create-react-app client to generate the React app.<br>
            
            Dockerfile Creation:
            Within the app directory (client), create a Dockerfile with necessary configurations.<br>
            
            Define Docker Image:
            Populate Dockerfile with code to define the Docker image.<br>
            
            Build Image:
            Build the Docker image with docker build -t docker-react ..<br>
            
            Run Image:
            Execute the image using docker run -p 3000:3000 docker-react.<br>
            
            View Output:
            Visit localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.<br>
            
            Containerizing your React app streamlines sharing and testing, ensuring smooth deployment across various environments.</p>

        <p>My journey with zeroOne began very unexpectedly .I enrolled at KLU not because I wanted to because I had no other choice. It was my last choice institution and i had my doubts. However, everything changed when i entered into my first meeting with zeroOne. I felt a sense of belonging and instantly knew that this was where I want to spend the rest of my college years. Contrary to my initial expectations, zeroOne is far from being just a serious club. We're a group of tech enthusiasts who live for the thrill of coding and innovation.
            From organizing captivating workshops to amazing hackathons to collaborating with other clubs on exciting projects, zeroOne is a dynamic club of creativity, knowledge and innovation. It is incredible to be surrounded by individuals who have been through the same challenges and can understand your excitement and hesitations.Our club president and his  team are nothing short of exceptional. They display dedication and vision in everything they do. It is their leadership that has made zeroOne the vibrant and thriving community it is today.
            My preconcieved notions about zeroOne were shattered and i found an exciting world of creativity and friendship.
            So please do come check it out.You might just find a second home and a life long passion , just as i did.  We're located at SAC hall in the R&D block</p>

          <p style="margin-top: -2px;">-Sai</p>
        <p>  JWTs comprise a header, payload, and signature, facilitating secure data exchange. They serve as digital ID <br>cards, streamlining authentication across websites. JWTs require minimal storage and offer robust security.<br>

            To implement JWT authentication in Node.js:<br>
            
            Install dependencies and set environment variables.<br>
            Connect to a MySQL database.<br>
            Create JWT and refresh token controllers.<br>
            Define login and refresh routes.<br>
            Ensure 'cookie-parser' is integrated and JSON bodies are parsed in 'server.js'.<br>
            
            For the full code and implementation details, refer to the provided GitHub link.</p>

            ZeroOne gave us tutors who made everything easy for every one of us... I still remember the first class I attended in M002A, we had to move to the SAC HALL because the crowd was too big, and no one could fit in the class. We occupied almost 3/4th of the SAC HALL and it was really so noisy, then time passed, and the crowd was under control. The entire session was so smooth and it was all because of the coordination among each other in the club. I was barely able to attend 2 sessions due to a few issues I had, but those few sessions made me feel good about myself. Slowly, SAC became the place where I spent my whole day.
I still remember the hackathon we had from 18th October to 19th October. The hackathon was virtually done but our whole project was a huge success because we had support from ZeroOne and it's mentors.During the experience, I was constantly forced to step out of my comfort zone, especially implementing features that I never had worked in.Thanks to the support from my team, I can confidently say, I have learnt and implemented lot of new concepts. This hackathon has boosted my confidence levels very high. Thanks to ZeroOne for this wonderful opportunity.

        <p>As I sit down to reflect on my journey with ZeroOne and Phantom, I can't help but feel a sense of gratitude for the opportunities and growth this community has provided me. Being part of ZeroOne has been more than just a learning experience; it has been a transformative journey that has shaped my perspective on technology, collaboration, and personal development.
            When I first joined ZeroOne, I was drawn to the vibrant community of passionate individuals eager to learn and innovate. From the very beginning, I felt welcomed and supported by fellow members who shared my enthusiasm for technology.
            One of the highlights of my journey with ZeroOne has been my involvement with Phantom, a dedicated team within the club focused on hands-on projects and innovation. Joining Phantom was a turning point for me, as it provided a platform to apply my skills in real-world projects and explore new technologies beyond the confines of traditional academic settings.
            Working with the Phantom team has been an incredibly rewarding experience. The collaborative environment fostered within Phantom has pushed me to think creatively, problem-solve effectively, and embrace innovation wholeheartedly. </p>
